I have professional experience in Java & Visual Basic .NET, with a focus on applications that interface with large databases via SQL. I also have experience in professionally developing websites with HTML, CSS and Javascript. In my free time I develop with Python, Ruby on Rails, Haskell and Processing - as well as electronics prototyping with the Arduino platform.</p>

                <p>My academic interests in computing and software are mainly focused on nonlinear dynamics, distributed and software defined networking, information theory, complexity and emergent behaviours, autonomous agents and generative art. I also maintain an interest in both the technological and social aspects of security, encryption, anonymity and privacy and their implementation in web based communications. Alongside these, I am deeply interested in social and historical topics within computing, such as as the development of encryption/cryptography, the origins of personal computing and the role of technology in labour dynamics.</p>

                <p>After obtaining a BSc (First Class) in Software Engineering, I worked as a software developer in small and large companies involving CRM software, eCommerce, client-server technologies and large enteprise applications. I have just finished online study of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud436">Computer Networking - Security and Software Defined Networking (CS6250)</a> and am currently studying <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses/ud061">Computability, Complexity & Algorithms - The Power and Limitation of Algorithms (CS6505)</a>, both built by the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am also currently growing my web development skills via the <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/autophagy">FreeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

                <p>Outside of computer science and software, I'm enthusiastic about cyberpunk media, insects, physics (I'm currently working through The Feynman Lectures), political economy and social history with a focus on the significance of technology in political movements during the Industrial Revolution in England. I also like to bake bread.</p>

                <p>I am currently seeking full/part time development work in Leipzig, teleworking and freelance software/web development opportunities. If any of these interest you, please <a href="#contact">contact</a> me.</p>

                        <h2>Multi/Timer</h2>
                        <p>Multi/Timer is a project I made after being frustrated with the quality of online timers, that I would use while cooking. They would often have the following problems:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Unable to have more than 1 timer at once (except by opening another window). This was problematic as I often needed to track multiple things at the same time.</li>
                            <li>When opening multiple windows to have multiple timers, I would often forget what each timer was for unless I had noted it down.</li>
                            <li>Not very mobile friendly, and often unnecessarily used flash or other plugins. This would make it hard while using it on a tablet in the kitchen.</li>
                            <li>Look terrible. Most of them seem to have been made a long time ago, or without any real consideration for visual aesthetics.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>So, I resolved to make a online tool that lets you have multiple timers on the same screen, with options to name and customise them, that functioned purely on HTML/CSS/Javascript <strong>and</strong> also looked good.</p>

                        <div class="centre-image">

                        </div>

                        <p>The project was really fun to work on, and I am especially proud of the colour palette picker that each timer uses, as well as the general look and feel of the project. I use it on a near-daily basis, and have discovered that a few other people also use it quite a lot too! This was a satisfying personal project to work on and I am still improving its usability, based on user feedback and pull requests.</p>

                        <p>The code for the project is at <a href="https://github.com/Autophagy/multitimer">Github</a> and you can use multi/timer at <a href="http://multitimer.io">multitimer.io</a>. I also wrote a <a href="/multitimer">small write-up</a> of the project's development process.</p>

                        <h2>Mainframe</h2>
                        <p>Mainframe is a web game based on bad cyberpunk movies and the Warioware games. The inspiration came from watching Hackers, and trying to think what kind of game could replicate the furious typing that the characters in the cyberpunk movies seem to constantly do. This formed the basis of a password cracking minigame, from which the rest of the game spiralled out.</p>

                        <p>The game was developed using the desktop and mobile HTML5 game framework <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>. The sprites, functionality and (most of) the sound effects were also made by me - I wanted to work on all the different aspects of this project, including the graphic and sound design.</p>

                        <p>Mainframe was featured on RockPaperShotgun's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/02/27/best-free-games-of-the-week-13/">best free games of the week</a>.

                        <h2>Twitter Background Restorer</h2>
                        <p>At some point in 2015, Twitter removed the feature that lets users set a background image or colour for their main timeline view and replaced it with a solid bright grey. This hurt my eyes, and had no reasonable benefit I could think of, so I wrote a chrome extension that put the old image back. This was originally purely for personal use but grew fairly popular!</p>

                        <p>Originally, due to Twitter's content security rules, the image could only be loaded into the CSS via the extension if it was on a twitter approved domain (such as twimg, or the facebook CDN). However, I got around this problem by loading the image into a canvas and storing, locally, the base 64 representation of the image. This could then be loaded into the CSS without violating the content security policy.</p>

                        <p>Since I made it, I have maintained and improved it by adding a more user-friendly settings page, functionality for tiling background and solid colour backgrounds, the ability to have individual rules based on the currently logged in twitter user, as well as small bug fixes.</p>

                        <p>It has been linked to in <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/21/twitter-removes-background-images-timeline-fix-chrom-plugin">The Guardian</a>, <a href="http://www.idigitaltimes.com/twitter-background-image-disappeared-heres-how-fix-it-460114">iDigitalTimes</a>, <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/07/21/as-twitter-turns-off-timeline-background-images-one-developer-has-already-built-a-workaround/">VentureBeat</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.jp/2015/07/_twitter_2.html">Gizmodo</a>, and <a href="http://www.lifehacker.co.uk/2015/07/21/how-to-get-your-background-wallpaper-back-on-twitter">Lifehacker</a> - among other places.</p>

                        <p>This project started out as a small experiment with pixel colour manipulation in Processing. I found that by averaging the pixel colour in triangular sections across an image, I could produce a simple but interesting looking pixelisation. The result looked a little crystalline!</p>

                        <p>I then rewrote this experiment from Processing (which is Java based) to Python, and integrated it with the Twitter API using the <a href="https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy">Tweepy</a> library. The script retrieves all tweets sent to the bot (since a given ID) and goes through each tweet. If the tweet contains an image, it is used as the scripts input and the result is sent back to the original tweeter. This script runs at set intervals as a cron job on my Raspberry Pi.</p>

It uses the same perlin noise based positoning, but also pulses the background based on beat detection and sets the radius of the segments based on the maximum value in the player's mix buffer.

                        <h2>DISC // Distributed and Secure Communications</h2>
                        <p>DISC was my final year project for my BSc Software Engineering degree. It came about through a desire to try and merge characteristics of Internet Relay Chat with the subjects of encryption, anonymity and peer-to-peer communication.</p>

                        <div class="centre-image">
                            <img src="images/projects/disc/disc-client.png" alt="A view of the DISC client">
                        </div>

                        <p>DISC allowed users to set up peer-to-peer text-based communication networks, encrypted end-to-end and transmitted through an anonymisation network. The peer-to-peer functionality was implemented via the use of sockets and an algorithm to propagate messages throughout the network by controlled broadcasting to the user's connected peers. The software also let users decide who they connected to as nodes in the network, allowing them to collectively control various aspects of the network such as diameter, bisection width and resource cost. The encryption of messages was done between nodes using public key cryptography & Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Private messaging between 2 nodes that are not directly connected was accomplished using encryption layering, with each layer containing an encrypted payload and directions for which node to pass the payload to, inspired by Tor's onion routing scheme. Anonymisation of clients was achieved through the use of <a href="https://geti2p.net">I2P</a> and their Java sockets API. The use of I2P's destination strings also allowed clients to invite other clients, without revealing their actual IP addresses through the invitations.</p>

                        <div class="centre-image">
                            <img src="images/projects/disc/network-diagram.png" alt="A view of an example network created in a DISC session">
                        </div>

                        <p>A large part of this project involved independent research on the topics of peer-to-peer network topologies, encryption/cryptography and anonymity in web communications. This allowed me to persue mathematical, technical and social research that I was interested in, but otherwise would not have come across in my other university modules. It also allowed me to think about the social and ethical concerns of secure and anonymous communication, and how they might affect aspects such as ease-of-use.</p>

                        <p>The development process took place over the final year of University and the approach I took was to develop a series of prototypes, 14 in total. Each prototype built upon the complexity of the previous prototype, until all required functionality was in place. It was imperative during development to maintain loose coupling between components, as I could develop without worrying that that I would break functionality in other places. It was also important for me to construct a long term schedule for the project's development, so that I could easily track my progress. When the project was finished, I evaluated it and also asked several people in the secure communication field to give feedback, which was incorporated into my final report.</p>

                        <p>The final grade for this project was 85% (Grade A). Since it was a major university project, I cannot openly host the code or report on Github, though it can be shared on request.</p>
